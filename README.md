# Getting the data from the bovi-analytics blob storage

ADJUST

You will need to get access key via Miel Hostens (<m.m.hostens@uu.nl>)

The data contains data from 8 farms using NEDAP sensors. An observation
from the NEDAP sensores was collected together with locomotion scores
from the animals.

  - HerdIdentifier - Identifier for the herd
  - Animalidentifier : Identifier for the animal (her eartag)
  - AnimalNumber : Secondary identifier for the animal
  - CalvingTime : Date of calving
  - SensorDaysInMilk : Days in milk at sensor observation
  - SensorDate : Date at sensor observation
  - SensorType: Multiple sensor observations were obtained, the type
    identifies which ones are usefull
  - SensorValue: Sensor value
  - ObservationDate: Date at which the locomotion or bcs scores were
    observed
  - ScoreDaysInMilk : Days in milk at which the locomotion or bcs scores
    were observed
  - ScoreType : Locomotion or BCS score
  - ScoreValue : Score value
  - ObservationDays : Days from sensor to score observation moment
